TODO List for django-contexthelp
================================

* make fully compatible with Django 1.3
* make a manage.py command for `create_help_objects_from_urls`
* gracefully handle duplicate usage of `create_help_objects_from_urls`
* make it installable, with version
* use caching on gettings help objects
* use caching on getting url_name (on the dumb method)
